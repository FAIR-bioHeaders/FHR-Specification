# Changelog

## v0.3 — 2026-10-07 (from v0.2)

- Add optional structured assembly software, assembly protocol URI, N90, GC-content
  percentage, and supplied refget sequence collection ID. Preserve legacy software names.
- Retain required fields and schemaVersion 1; make ORCID's string type explicit.
- Align LinkML generation with the published contract and add equivalence checks.
- Replace speculative resource mappings with verified partial MIxS/MIGS projections.
- Correct JSON/YAML, FASTA/GFA, and escaped/typed microdata examples.
- Adopt exact-byte SHA-512/256 coverage of metadata and sequence, except the checksum
  line; old MD5/payload-only examples must be regenerated, not relabeled.
- Add CI, explicit schema drift protection, a generated diagram, project guidance,
  and a successor governance proposal. Reporting contacts/adoption remain review gates.
- Use verified Chicago bibliography citations with concept DOI links.

Nextflow modules remain a separate future repository. The governance plan is a
proposal, and the release has not been published.
