# Specification Quality Checklist: FAIR header assessment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (FR-011 online resolution, FR-012 criteria basis: asked of the maintainers)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (text formats; binary formats out of scope)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- File-format conventions (GFF3 `##`, GAF `!`, VCF `##`) are named as domain inputs, not
  implementation choices.
- Two clarifications remain; they are resolved before `/speckit-plan`.
