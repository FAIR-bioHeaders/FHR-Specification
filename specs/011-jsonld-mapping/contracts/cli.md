# Contract: JSON-LD in the toolkit (`.jsonld` input and output)

**Feature**: 011-jsonld-mapping | **Repository**: FAIR-bioHeaders-Tools (package `fair-bioheaders`, import and command `bioheaders`) | Research: R-04, R-07, R-09, R-11, R-12, R-13

JSON-LD becomes one more metadata format beside `json`, `yaml`, `fasta`, `gfa` and `microdata`.
- No new subcommand.
- No new `fhr-*` entry point.
- The existing command behaviour does not change (toolkit constitution V).
- The writer and the canonical reader add **no runtime dependency**. Only the general reader
  (US3, not in the MVP) will need the optional extra `fair-bioheaders[jsonld]`.

## Format dispatch

| Change in `bioheaders/cli.py` | Value |
|---|---|
| `FORMATS` | Add `".jsonld": "jsonld"` |
| `FORMAT_NAMES` (the choices for `--from`, `--to` and the other format options) | Add `"jsonld": "jsonld"` |

- The format is taken from the extension before `.gz`/`.bgz`, as for every other format, so
  `x.jsonld.gz` is BGZF-compressed JSON-LD.
- Stdin and stdout need `--from jsonld` or `--to jsonld`.
- Every command that reads or writes a metadata file accepts JSON-LD through the existing
  `read_metadata`/`write_metadata` dispatch:
  - `bioheaders convert` and `fhr-convert`;
  - `bioheaders validate` and `fhr-validate`;
  - the metadata argument of `combine` and `fhr-*-combine`.

```text
bioheaders convert examples/example.fhr.json /tmp/example.fhr.jsonld
bioheaders convert /tmp/example.fhr.jsonld /tmp/example.fhr.yaml
bioheaders validate /tmp/example.fhr.jsonld
bioheaders convert --from jsonld --to json - - < page-record.jsonld
bioheaders combine /tmp/example.fhr.jsonld genome.fa -o genome.fhr.fa   # metadata format from the extension
```

New options:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--export-context FILE` (`convert`; MVP, maintainer decision 2) | none | JSON-LD output only (any other output format is an error). A YAML or JSON mapping with the optional keys `id` (the dataset IRI, an absolute URL), `url` (its landing page, an absolute URL) and `keywords` (a non-empty list of non-empty strings); any other key is an error. Provisional until #56 defines the shared export context. See "Writing" step 5 |
| `--ignore-unknown-terms` (`convert`, `validate`; US3, not in the MVP) | off | General-path JSON-LD input only (rule J4). Terms that do not map to an FHR field are reported on stderr as warnings, and conversion continues. Without the option they are an error. It has no effect on other formats or on canonical JSON-LD |

## Writing (rule J7): byte layout

`output_jsonld()` returns exactly:

```python
json.dumps(document, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2) + "\n"
```

`document` is built as follows. Dicts keep insertion order.

1. `"@context"`: the value of the `"@context"` key of the bundled `bioheaders/fhr.context.jsonld`,
   embedded, not as a URL (research R-09).
2. `"@type": "Dataset"`.
3. Every record key, in record order, with its value unchanged except that nested objects gain a
   first key `"@type"`:
   - `taxon`: `"Taxon"`;
   - each item of `metadataAuthor` and `assemblyAuthor` (maintainer decision 4): `"Person"` if
     its `uri` matches the `fhr.json` ORCID pattern (`https://orcid.org/NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNX`, a
     prefix match), `"Organization"` if its `uri` is a ROR ID
     (`https://ror.org/0` + six lowercase letters or digits + two digits), else `"Agent"`;
   - `accessionID`: `"PropertyValue"`;
   - each **object** item of the `assemblySoftware` array: `"SoftwareApplication"` (a legacy
     string is unchanged);
   - `vitalStats`: `"VitalStats"`.

   A `documentation` value that is an absolute URL (`[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9+.-]*://` followed by
   one or more non-whitespace characters, the whole value) is written under the key
   `"subjectOf"` in the same position (maintainer decision 3). Text stays under
   `"documentation"`.
4. Nothing else is added. Absent optional fields stay absent, and no `null` and no empty node is
   emitted (spec edge case). A record with a key starting with `@` at any depth, or with a root
   key `subjectOf`, `keywords`, `url` or `conformsTo`, cannot be written (`ValueError`).
5. **Export context** (optional, maintainer decision 2): its `id` becomes `"@id"`, right after
   `"@type"`; its `keywords` and `url` follow the record keys, in that order. Then, only if every
   minimum property of the Bioschemas Dataset profile 1.0-RELEASE is present in the document
   (`@id`; `description` = `documentation` as text; `identifier` non-empty; `keywords`;
   `license` = `reuseConditions`; `name` = `genome`; `url`), `"conformsTo":
   "https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Dataset/1.0-RELEASE"` is added last. Dataset 1.1 was a
   draft on 2026-10-10, so 1.0-RELEASE is the release checked (research R-04). Otherwise
   `convert` prints `FHR: JSON-LD: not claiming Bioschemas Dataset conformance; missing: <names>`
   and writes the document without `conformsTo`.

**Warnings.** For each key inside `taxon`, an author item, `accessionID` or `vitalStats` that the
context does not define, `convert` prints one line to stderr and still writes the output:

```text
FHR: JSON-LD: taxon.checksum has no JSON-LD term; linked-data consumers will ignore it
```

The path uses `[i]` for array items, for example `assemblyAuthor[0].affiliation`.

`examples/example.fhr.jsonld` and `examples/minimal.fhr.jsonld` in FHR-Specification are this
output for the two JSON examples. The toolkit's output must be byte-identical (rule J7).

## Reading

`input_jsonld(stream)` decodes UTF-8, ignoring a BOM as `input_json` does, and parses JSON with
duplicate-key rejection (J2). It then chooses a path.

### Canonical path (J1): no dependency, works on Python 3.9

The document takes this path when all of these hold:
- the root is an object with `"@context"`;
- its value is either
  - an object equal, as parsed JSON, to the `"@context"` value of a **bundled context**; or
  - a string in `KNOWN_CONTEXT_URLS`:
    - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FAIR-bioHeaders/FHR-Specification/main/jsonld/fhr.context.jsonld`;
    - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FAIR-bioHeaders/FHR-Specification/vX.Y.Z/jsonld/fhr.context.jsonld`;
    - `https://w3id.org/fair-bioheaders/fhr/vX.Y.Z/jsonld/fhr.context.jsonld`.

    The release URLs are recognised for each bundled release `vX.Y.Z`. No FHR-Specification
    release contains the context yet, so the MVP bundles only the context of `main` and
    recognises only the raw-main URL. Nothing is fetched;
- the only keys starting with `@` anywhere are the root `@context`, an optional root `@id` (a
  string) and `@type` on objects;
- every `@type` value is a string or an array of strings.

The toolkit then removes the root `@context` and every `@type` (FR-009). A root `subjectOf`
string becomes `documentation` (both together are an error: `JSON-LD gives both documentation
and subjectOf`). The export terms `@id`, `keywords`, `url` and `conformsTo` are removed, each
with the warning `FHR: JSON-LD: <key> is export metadata, not an FHR field; it was not kept`.
The remaining object is loaded exactly as `input_json` would load it. `fhr_validate()` (and so `convert` and `validate`)
validates it against the bundled `fhr_schema.json`, following the toolkit's schema-version
policy.

### General path (J3 to J6): needs `fair-bioheaders[jsonld]` and Python 3.10 or later

**Not in the MVP (US3).** Until it exists, every non-canonical document fails with
`FHR: this JSON-LD is not in the canonical FAIR-bioHeaders form (rule J1 of FHR-Specification
docs/JSONLD.md); reading other JSON-LD forms is not supported yet`, whether or not PyLD is
installed; the "needs the jsonld extra" message below arrives with the extra.

Every other JSON object document takes this path. Input that is not an object or an array is
invalid.

1. If PyLD is not installed, the read fails:

   ```text
   FHR: reading this JSON-LD form needs the jsonld extra: pip install "fair-bioheaders[jsonld]"
   ```
2. **Expand** (JSON-LD 1.1) with a document loader that serves only the bundled contexts, under
   `KNOWN_CONTEXT_URLS`. Any other URL gives:

   ```text
   FHR: JSON-LD context is not available offline: <url>
   ```

   There is no network access in any case (FR-005).
3. Collect the terms that expansion drops, through `on_property_dropped`.
4. There must be exactly one top-level node object, directly or as the only item of `@graph`.
   Otherwise:

   ```text
   FHR: JSON-LD must describe exactly one FHR record (found N nodes)
   ```
5. **Map** the expanded node back to FHR keys, scope by scope, using the reverse of the bundled
   context (data-model §4):
   - Values: `{"@value": v}` becomes `v`.
   - IRI-valued fields accept `{"@id": iri}` or `{"@value": iri}`.
   - `dateCreated` accepts `@type` `xsd:date` or no type. Any other datatype is an error.
   - The `@id` of a taxon or author node becomes `uri`.
   - `@list` becomes an array.
   - A schema array field becomes a list in document order.
   - A single-valued field with more than one value is an error:

     ```text
     FHR: JSON-LD gives 2 values for single-valued field genome
     ```
   - `assemblySoftware` with a single string value becomes that string (the legacy form).
   - A nested node given only as `{"@id": ...}`, without properties (flattened form), is an
     error.
   - Every `@type` is set aside.
6. **Unknown terms.** Dropped terms (step 3), and expanded IRIs that map to no FHR field in their
   scope (including a root `@id`), are listed:

   ```text
   FHR: JSON-LD term not in the FHR mapping: http://schema.org/keywords (at the record)
   ```

   Without `--ignore-unknown-terms`, any such term makes the read fail with exit 1. With it, each
   is printed with the prefix `FHR: warning:`, and reading continues.
7. The resulting record goes through the same validation as JSON (J6).

The general reader emits keys in `fhr.json` property order, and nested keys in their class
property order. Equality with the original record is order-insensitive for keys (research R-12).

## Errors and exit codes

There are no new exit codes:
- `0` on success;
- `1` on any error above, any schema validation failure or any I/O error, through the existing
  `run()`;
- argparse errors exit `2`.

Messages use the existing `FHR: ` prefix, and existing messages are unchanged.

## Python API (provisional, documented in the README)

```python
from bioheaders import fhr
from bioheaders import jsonld          # new module

record = fhr()
record.input_json(open("examples/example.fhr.json", "rb"))
text = record.output_jsonld()          # str, the byte layout above
text = record.output_jsonld(export={"id": "...", "url": "...", "keywords": ["..."]})
record.input_jsonld(open("x.jsonld", "rb"))           # canonical path (MVP)
record.input_jsonld(stream, warn=messages.append)     # collect the export-term warnings
record.input_jsonld(stream, ignore_unknown_terms=True)  # general path, US3

jsonld.CONTEXT                          # dict: the bundled context document
jsonld.BUNDLED_CONTEXTS                 # tuple of (version, context); MVP: (("main", CONTEXT),)
jsonld.KNOWN_CONTEXT_URLS               # tuple of str
jsonld.to_jsonld(data: dict, export=None) -> dict    # writer, steps 1 to 5
jsonld.from_jsonld(doc, *, ignore_unknown_terms=False, warn=print_to_stderr) -> dict
jsonld.is_canonical(doc) -> bool        # rule J1
jsonld.unmapped_keys(data: dict) -> list[str]   # paths for the writer warnings
jsonld.check_export(export) -> dict     # validates an export context
jsonld.bioschemas_missing(doc) -> list[str]     # missing Bioschemas Dataset minimum properties
```

`warn` receives messages without the `FHR: ` prefix; the default prints them to stderr with it.
FHR-Specification's `scripts/make_jsonld.py` has the same reference writer and canonical reader
(`to_jsonld`, `canonical_record`), which the specification tests and vectors use.

`from_jsonld` raises `ValueError` with the messages above. It never performs I/O except calling
`warn`.

## Packaging

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `bioheaders/fhr.context.jsonld` | New. Byte-identical to FHR-Specification `jsonld/fhr.context.jsonld` |
| `pyproject.toml` | `include` gains `bioheaders/fhr.context.jsonld`. With US3: a new extra `[tool.poetry.extras] jsonld = ["pyld"]`, with `pyld = {version = "^3.3", optional = true, python = ">=3.10"}`, and `pyld` in the dev group with the same marker (the MVP adds neither). Runtime `dependencies` are unchanged |
| `fhr/` and root compatibility copies | None. The context is not a schema copy and is not needed by the checkout-only `fhr/` scripts |
| `compat/fhr` | No change. The `fhr` distribution requires `fair-bioheaders` without extras |

## Guarantees (tested)

1. **Offline.** Every JSON-LD operation works with sockets disabled. The general path's loader
   raises for every URL that is not bundled.
2. **Round trip** (FR-004, SC-001). `from_jsonld(to_jsonld(r)) == r` for every valid record,
   compared by JSON value and type (research R-12), through the canonical path. Through the
   general path it holds for records without nested keys that lack a term.
3. **Deterministic.** The output bytes depend only on the record and the bundled context.
4. **Schema unchanged** (FR-009). `fhr_schema.json` and its two copies are untouched. JSON-LD
   keywords never reach the validator.
