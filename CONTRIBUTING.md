# Contributing

Start with an issue describing the use case or failure and a small reproducible
example. Submit a focused branch/PR with behavior, compatibility implications,
and relevant validation. Link related work in [FHR-File-Converter](https://github.com/FAIR-bioHeaders/FHR-File-Converter)
and the release tracker when a change spans repositories. Do not include private
genome data, credentials, or unrelated formatting in fixtures.

## Setup and checks

See README for Python requirements and environment setup. From this checkout:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-linkml.txt
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python scripts/validate_examples.py
python scripts/check_linkml.py
python scripts/check_schema_drift.py
```

Changes to metadata must coordinate `fhr.json`, the LinkML model, both converter
schema copies, serializers, examples, and documentation. Add regression tests
for changed behavior, including minimal metadata and relevant invalid cases.
Document checksum semantics and migration rather than silently changing identity.
Keep required metadata and runtime dependencies small.

David and Adam retain schema authority. The [successor governance proposal](https://github.com/FAIR-bioHeaders/FHR-Specification/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md)
is awaiting adoption; its voting/transition rules are not currently effective.
Follow CODE_OF_CONDUCT and use the SECURITY policy for sensitive findings. The
the private reporting address is documented there; the independent conflict/appeal route still needs confirmation.

Release preparation does not authorize publishing packages, merging PRs, or
transferring repository ownership. Keep companion PRs linked for coordinated review.

## Coordinated documentation and citations

Guidance and README changes are tracked in [specification issue #23](https://github.com/FAIR-bioHeaders/FHR-Specification/issues/23). The private conduct/security contact is confirmed; finalize the independent conflict-reporting route before treating the policies as fully operational.

Use Chicago bibliography entries with DOI resolver links in human-readable citations. Keep the published paper, preprint, specification and converter distinct; preserve concept DOI meaning and existing BibTeX keys. CFF/BibTeX remain machine-readable metadata. The file audit and companion PRs are recorded in [FHR-Citation/AUDIT.md](https://github.com/FAIR-bioHeaders/FHR-Citation/blob/release-v0.3/AUDIT.md), tracked by [issue #25](https://github.com/FAIR-bioHeaders/FHR-Specification/issues/25).
