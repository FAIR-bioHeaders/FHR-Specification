abstract: >-
  The lack of interoperable data standards among reference
  genome data-sharing platforms inhibits cross-platform
  analysis while increasing the risk of data provenance
  loss. Here, we describe the FAIR-bioHeaders Reference
  genome (FHR), a metadata standard guided by the principles
  of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse
  (FAIR) in addition to the principles of Transparency,
  Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability, and Technology
  (TRUST). The objective of FHR is to provide an extensive
  set of data serialisation methods and minimum data field
  requirements while still maintaining extensibility,
  flexibility, and expressivity in an increasingly
  decentralised genomic data ecosystem. The effort needed to
  implement FHR is low; FHRâ€™s design philosophy ensures easy
  implementation while retaining the benefits gained from
  recording both machine and human-readable provenance.
