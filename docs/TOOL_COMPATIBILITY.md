# Tool compatibility of FHR-headed files

This survey tests how common bioinformatics tools handle FASTA, GFA and GFF3
files that carry FHR header lines (`;~` in FASTA, `#~` in GFA and GFF3). It
answers [#40](https://github.com/FAIR-bioHeaders/FHR-Specification/issues/40)
(FASTA and GFA tools) and
[#49](https://github.com/FAIR-bioHeaders/FHR-Specification/issues/49) (GFF3
tools; spec 007 FR-006). Run date: 2026-10-08.

## Method

Every test runs twice in fresh directories. One run uses a header-free control
file and the other uses the same file with an FHR header. Each output is reduced
to a fingerprint: record names, lengths and an MD5 of the upper-cased sequence
for FASTA/SAM output, sorted `S`/`L`/`P` lines for GFA, and an MD5 of the text
with `;~`/`#~` lines removed for other outputs. For FASTA, only the leading `;`
block is excluded; `;` text inside a record counts as sequence, so absorbed
header text shows up as a change. The two fingerprints are then compared.
Separately, the survey counts how many FHR lines the tool copied into its
output. The runner marks differences as `b?`. Each one was checked by hand
against its diff in
[results/diff](../scripts/tool_survey/results/diff), and all are reported
below as **b**.

| Class | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **a** | Works. Exit 0 and output identical to the control run. The header is ignored, or copied through (see "header kept"). |
| **b** | Works but misreads the header as sequence or names. Exit 0 and output differs from the control: silent corruption. |
| **c** | Fails. Non-zero exit, or **c (exit 0)**: prints an error and writes no data but exits 0. |
| n/a | The control file fails too, so the header is not the cause. |

Inputs come from [scripts/tool_survey/make_inputs.py](../scripts/tool_survey/make_inputs.py),
and the runner is [run_survey.py](../scripts/tool_survey/run_survey.py). The
raw results are in [results.tsv](../scripts/tool_survey/results/results.tsv).

- **FASTA**: three records (5000, 3000 and 1200 bp; 60-column lines; one
  soft-masked stretch). The FHR copy is made with `fhr-fasta-combine` 0.3.3 and
  [example.fhr.yaml](../examples/example.fhr.yaml), giving 52 `;~` lines.
  Variants: plain; gzip (made with Python `gzip`, not BGZF); BGZF (written by
  `fhr-fasta-combine -o x.fa.gz`; the BGZF control was made with
  `fhr-fasta-strip`); CRLF line endings; unwrapped (for `fasta-2line`); and
  `edge.comment1.fa`, which has one leading `;` line. That edge file is not
  valid FHR. It probes parsers that read leading lines as an unnamed record.
  Two concatenations, both invalid under R10, test what happens when header
  lines follow a record. `concat.fhr.fa` is `cat genome.fhr.fa extra.fhr.fa`.
  `concat.mixed.fa` is `cat genome.fa extra.fhr.fa`. Both are compared with
  `cat genome.fa extra.fa`.
- **GFA**: GFA1 with four segments, four links and two paths. The FHR copy is
  made with `fhr-gfa-combine`. A copy with numeric segment IDs is used for odgi.
- **GFF3**: three genes (one with two mRNAs), multi-line CDS features, and two
  `##sequence-region` lines. FHGFF3 is unreleased, so the 25 `#~` lines are
  hand-written, schema-like YAML. The lines follow `##gff-version 3` and come
  either before (`fhr.gff3`) or after (`fhr.sr-before.gff3`) the
  `##sequence-region` lines. A third variant has a `##FASTA` section.
- **Mapping**: 20 exact 150 bp reads. A small BAM for the counting tools is made
  by mapping them to the control genome.

## GFA

| Tool | Version | Command | Class | Header kept | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gfatools stat | 0.4-r214 (bioconda gfatools 0.5.5) | `gfatools stat` | a | n/a | |
| gfatools gfa2fa | same | `gfatools gfa2fa` | a | no | |
| gfatools view | same | `gfatools view` | a | no | `#` lines dropped. |
| vg | 1.76.1 | `vg convert -g x.gfa -f`; `vg stats -lz` | a | no | Warns `[GFAParser] Ignoring unrecognized # line type`. |
| odgi | 0.9.4 | `odgi build -g`; `stats -S`; `view -g` | a | no | Numeric-ID copy. odgi rejects non-numeric segment names whether or not there is a header. |
| gfapy | 1.2.3 | `Gfa.from_file`; `to_file` | a | yes (52) | Comments are kept and written back. |

No GFA tool tested misreads `#~` lines: `#` comments are part of GFA1.

## GFF3

Each row covers three inputs: header before `##sequence-region`, header after
`##sequence-region`, and a file with a `##FASTA` section. Results did not
differ between the first two.

| Tool | Version | Command | Class | Header kept | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GenomeTools `gt gff3validator` | 1.6.5 | `gt gff3validator` | a | n/a | `input is valid GFF3` for all three. |
| GenomeTools `gt gff3` | 1.6.5 | `gt gff3 -sort -tidy -retainids` | a | yes (25) | Moves `##sequence-region` lines above the `#~` block. |
| gffread | 0.12.9 | `-T`; `-E -o`; `-g genome.fa -x` | a | no | Writes its own `# gffread` comment lines instead. |
| AGAT | 1.7.0 | `agat_convert_sp_gxf2gxf.pl`; `agat_sp_statistics.pl` | a | yes (25) | Header kept in place (after `##gff-version 3`); statistics identical. |
| gffutils | 0.14 | `create_db(..., merge_strategy="create_unique")` | a | n/a | Features and `directives` identical; `#~` lines are not stored. |
| bedtools | 2.31.1 | `sort -header`; `intersect` | a | `sort -header`: yes | The `##FASTA` variant is n/a (bedtools reads the FASTA lines as features). |
| bgzip + tabix | htslib 1.24 | sort, `bgzip`, `tabix -p gff`, region query | a | `tabix -H`: yes | Header lines must stay at the top when sorting (`grep '^#'` first). `##FASTA` is n/a (tabix cannot parse it). |
| htseq-count | HTSeq 2.1.2 | `-f bam -t exon -i Parent` | a | n/a | `##FASTA` is n/a (HTSeq rejects it in the control too). |
| featureCounts | subread 2.1.1 | `-F GTF -t exon -g Parent` | a | n/a | |
| JBrowse CLI | 4.3.0 | `add-track`; `text-index` | a | n/a | Trix index byte-identical to the control. |
| `@gmod/gff` (JBrowse 2 parser) | 2.1.0 | `parseStringSync` | a | as comments | `#~` lines come back as comment items; features, directives and sequences match. |

## Concatenated files (invalid under R10)

`cat a.fhr.fa b.fhr.fa` and `cat a.fa b.fhr.fa` leave `;~` lines after the last
record of the first file. R10 makes such a file invalid, and
`fhr-fasta-validate` rejects it. Concatenating FASTA files is routine, though,
so the survey also ran the FASTA tools on these files.

| Tool | `cat fhr + fhr` | `cat plain + fhr` | Effect when it "works" |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| samtools dict | **b** | **b** | chrM length 1200 → 2613 and a different M5: the header text is counted as chrM sequence. |
| pysam.FastxFile, seqtk seq/comp, bioawk | **b** | **b** | chrM 1200 → 2719. |
| minimap2 (`-d`, `-a`) | **b** | **b** | `@SQ SN:chrM LN:2719` in the index and the SAM header. |
| kallisto index | **b** | **b** | k-mers 9,880 → 11,367 (the header is indexed as target sequence). |
| seqkit stats/seq/grep | c | **b** | Rejects a leading `;` but absorbs later `;` lines into chrM. |
| Biopython `fasta` | c | **b** | chrM 1200 → 2613. |
| bowtie2-build, hisat2-build | c | **b** | chrM 1886 in the index. |
| STAR, salmon | c | **b** | STAR `chrNameLength` chrM 2719; salmon offsets show chrM 2687. |
| Picard CreateSequenceDictionary | c | **b** | chrM 2719 with a different M5. |
| UCSC faToTwoBit, faSize | c | **b** | chrM 2279 (non-letters dropped). |
| pyfastx | c | **b** | chrM 2714. |
| BWA | c | c | `bwa index` exits 0, but `bwa mem` then fails: `[bns_restore_core] Parse error reading .amb`. |
| samtools faidx, bedtools getfasta, pysam.FastaFile | c | c | Fails here only because the header lines differ in width from chrM's lines (`Different line length in sequence 'chrM'`). With equal widths faidx indexes the text: `printf '>a\nACGT\n;mid\n>b\nGG\n'` gives `a` length 8, sequence `ACGT;mid`. |
| pyfaidx, MAFFT, gffread, AGAT/BioPerl, seqkit faidx, JBrowse | c | c | |
| makeblastdb, Biopython `fasta-pearson` | a | a | Skip `;` lines anywhere. |

## Silent corruption

**Valid FHR files.** No tool silently changed sequence data, names or
features. Every class **a** result had a fingerprint identical to its control.
This covers BWA, minimap2, kallisto, makeblastdb, MAFFT, seqtk, bioawk,
pysam.FastxFile, Biopython `fasta-pearson`, and all GFA and GFF3 tools.

**Concatenated files (above).** These are the main corruption risk. Most
tools that accept a leading header silently append a later header to the
previous record's sequence. That changes its length, its MD5 and SeqCol
digests, any `.dict`, and the aligner indexes. The tools that reject a leading
header (STAR, Picard, UCSC, seqkit, bowtie2, salmon) do the same with a header
that follows a record. The FHR rules already forbid this. Strip each FHR file
before concatenating it with others, and run `fhr-fasta-validate` on inputs.

**One leading comment line (pyfaidx).** With exactly one leading `;` line, or
several of equal width, pyfaidx indexes the comment as an unnamed sequence:

```text
$ printf ';~ab: 1\n;~cd: 2\n>chr1\nACGTACGT\nACGT\n' > eq.fa
$ python -c 'import pyfaidx; f=pyfaidx.Fasta("eq.fa"); print({k: str(f[k][:]) for k in f.keys()})'
{'None': ';~ab: 1;~cd: 2', 'chr1': 'ACGTACGTACGT'}
$ cat eq.fa.fai
None	14	0	7	8
chr1	12	22	8	9
```

Real FHR headers have lines of different widths, so pyfaidx fails with an
error instead. The edge case still affects files with legacy `;` comments.

Related, smaller risks:

- **Errors with exit 0.** `seqkit stats` reports `invalid FASTA/Q format` but
  exits 0 and prints an empty table, so a pipeline does not stop. Likewise,
  `bwa index` succeeds on a concatenated file and the failure appears only at
  `bwa mem`.
- **Partial output.** Picard leaves a `.dict` file holding only `@HD`, which a
  make-style workflow may treat as up to date.
- **Stale headers in derived files.** `gt gff3`, AGAT, `bedtools sort -header`,
  tabix and gfapy copy `#~` lines into files whose bytes have changed. The
  copied `checksum` then no longer matches the file. FHR validation catches
  this; anything that reads the header without validating it does not. `gt`
  also reorders `##sequence-region` lines above the header block (relevant to
  the open placement question in spec 007 FR-001).

## Summary of risks

1. **FASTA indexing is the main gap for valid files.** htslib faidx rejects the
   file, and so does everything built on it: samtools faidx, pysam.FastaFile,
   bedtools getfasta, JBrowse assemblies, and bcftools/GATK-style reference
   loading. htsjdk (Picard), pyfaidx, seqkit, pyfastx, UCSC tools, gffread,
   BioPerl `Bio::DB::Fasta`, the Burrows-Wheeler builders (bowtie2, HISAT2),
   STAR and salmon all reject it too. All of these fail loudly.
2. **kseq-based tools work.** BWA, minimap2, seqtk, bioawk, pysam.FastxFile and
   kallisto, plus makeblastdb, MAFFT and Biopython `fasta-pearson`, ignore the
   leading `;` block.
3. **Concatenation corrupts data silently.** A header after the first record
   is read as sequence by most tools, including samtools dict, minimap2,
   STAR, salmon, kallisto and Picard. R10 forbids this layout; validation
   and stripping before `cat` avoid it.
4. **GFA and GFF3 headers are compatible** with every tool tested. GFF3 tools
   either drop `#~` comments or keep them (some reordered). Failures seen with
   `##FASTA` sections come from the `##FASTA` section, not from the header.

## Recommended workarounds

Strip the header for FASTA tools in class **c**. With the converter (0.3.3),
the output keeps every other byte; a `.gz` output name gives BGZF, which faidx
can index:

```bash
fhr-fasta-strip genome.fhr.fa.gz genome.fa.gz   # BGZF output
samtools faidx genome.fa.gz                      # verified: index and fetch work
fhr-fasta-strip genome.fhr.fa genome.fa          # uncompressed
fhr-fasta-strip genome.fhr.fa - | seqkit stats - # streaming
```

Without the converter, drop every line that starts with `;`. R10 allows FHR
lines only before the first record, and samtools rejects any `;` line anyway:

```bash
sed '/^;/d' genome.fhr.fa > genome.fa
zcat genome.fhr.fa.gz | sed '/^;/d' | bgzip > genome.fa.gz
```

Keep the FHR file as the archival copy; the stripped copy is derived. The FHR
metadata can be kept beside it as JSON/YAML with `fhr-convert`.

- **Biopython**: use `SeqIO.parse(path, "fasta-pearson")`.
- **GFA**: no action needed. `fhr-gfa-strip` or `grep -v '^#~'` gives the
  original bytes back.
- **GFF3**: no action needed. To remove the header use `grep -v '^#~' x.gff3`
  (verified byte-identical to the control). Re-run FHR combine on derived files
  instead of keeping the copied header.
- **tabix**: when sorting, keep all `#` lines on top:
  `(grep '^#' x.gff3; grep -v '^#' x.gff3 | sort -k1,1 -k4,4n) | bgzip > x.gff3.gz`.

To combine FASTA files, strip each FHR file first:

```bash
for f in *.fhr.fa; do fhr-fasta-strip "$f" -; done > combined.fa
```

Then add a new header to the result with `fhr-fasta-combine` if needed.

Native support in htslib would remove most FASTA stripping. The draft proposal
is [proposals/htslib-fasta-comments.md](proposals/htslib-fasta-comments.md).

Stripping a header removes its metadata from the working copy. For files that
cannot carry an FHR header, or tools that need a stripped copy, the
[FAIR header guideline](FAIR_HEADER_GUIDELINE.md) shows how to keep the same
metadata in each format's native header lines (GFF3 `##`/`#!`, VCF `##`,
GAF `!`). `bioheaders assess` reports what a header already provides; its shared
fixtures are in [assessment/](../assessment/README.md).

## Not tested

- **Bandage**: GUI only.
- **GATK**: large install; it uses htsjdk, as Picard does.
- **pybedtools**: wraps bedtools.
- **EMBOSS**: the bioconda package failed to extract.
- **GFA2 and rGFA tags**: only GFA1 was tested.
- **Protein FASTA and MAFFT/MUSCLE protein modes**: not needed for #40.
- **GFF3 and GFA concatenation**: `#~` lines after features are ordinary
  comments to these tools, so data cannot be corrupted. The result is still
  invalid FHR.
