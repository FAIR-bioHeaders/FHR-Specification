# FHR conformance vectors

These FASTA and GFA files show how FHR header lines are parsed and which bytes the
SHA-512/256 checksum covers, as defined in
[docs/FORMAT.md](../docs/FORMAT.md#checksum-decision-for-v03). The HTML files show
how FHR metadata is extracted from microdata, as defined in
[docs/MICRODATA.md](../docs/MICRODATA.md#reading-rules). Use them to check an FHR
reader or writer in any language against the specification.

## Layout

- `valid/`: files that a conforming implementation must accept.
- `invalid/`: files that it must reject.
- `manifest.json`: the expected outcome for every file.
- `*.gz`: gzip or BGZF copies. Validate their decompressed bytes.

Every file is byte-exact. `.gitattributes` turns off line-ending conversion for
this directory, so CR and CRLF vectors stay unchanged in every checkout. Don't
open and re-save them in an editor. Run the generator instead.

## Manifest

`rules` maps each stable rule id to a short summary: R1 to R10 from
docs/FORMAT.md and M1 to M4 from docs/MICRODATA.md. The same ids appear in
brackets in those documents, where the rule text is authoritative. R9 (repeated
attributes and token lists) and M1 to M4 are tested by the microdata vectors.

Every entry in `vectors` has these fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Stable vector name |
| `file` | Path relative to this directory |
| `format` | `fasta`, `gfa` or `microdata` (HTML) |
| `compressed` | `true` for gzip/BGZF files; `compression` then gives `gzip` or `bgzf` |
| `expected` | `valid` or `invalid` |
| `rules` | Valid vectors only: the rules the file exercises |
| `description` | Valid vectors only: what the file exercises |
| `checksum` | Valid FASTA/GFA vectors only: the expected FHR checksum, base64 SHA-512/256 |
| `metadata` | Valid FASTA/GFA vectors: some expected parsed values (`genome`, `version`, `masking`). Valid microdata vectors: the complete expected metadata object. `microdata-schema-invalid`: the metadata it yields, which fails `fhr.json` |
| `rule` | Invalid vectors only: the rule the file breaks |
| `reason` | Invalid vectors only: how the file breaks that rule |

An invalid vector breaks one rule and is otherwise correct. Where possible its
stated checksum matches the bytes, so an implementation can't pass by failing the
checksum comparison by accident. The R1, R3 and R4 vectors are the exception:
they deliberately carry a checksum computed the wrong way, or one made stale by
editing the file. Reasons describe the defect, not any implementation's error
message.

Compressed valid vectors decompress to the bytes of `fasta-lf` or `gfa-lf` and
have the same checksum.

Microdata has no checksum coverage rule: its `checksum` property is an ordinary
metadata value (here the `fasta-lf` checksum). A valid microdata vector instead
pins the whole extracted object, so every tricky value (first-wins attributes,
token lists, implied end tags, value attributes, escaping, typed and untyped
values) is checked exactly. JSON numbers compare by value, so `1` and `1.0` are
equal, but strings, numbers and booleans are never equal to each other. Valid metadata conforms to `fhr.json`. The checksums are
real; valid vectors carry no placeholder checksum or SeqCol value.

## Using the vectors in another implementation

For each manifest entry, read `file` and decompress it if `compressed` is true.
For a `valid` FASTA/GFA vector, your implementation must accept the file, compute
`checksum`, and parse the listed `metadata` values. For a `valid` microdata vector,
it must extract exactly `metadata`. For an `invalid` vector, it
must reject the file. Reporting the rule id is optional. Treat any difference as
a bug in the implementation or the vectors, and report it as an issue.

To run the FHR File Converter (or another CLI with the same commands and exit
codes) over the vectors. FASTA and GFA vectors go to `fhr-fasta-validate` and
`fhr-gfa-validate`. Microdata vectors go to `fhr-convert in.html out.json`, and
the JSON it writes must equal `metadata`:

```bash
python scripts/check_conformance.py --converter           # commands on PATH
python scripts/check_conformance.py --converter .venv     # a virtual environment
python scripts/check_conformance.py --converter ../FHR-File-Converter  # a checkout
```

## Regenerating and checking

`scripts/make_conformance.py` builds every vector from small templates. It
computes the checksums with Python's `hashlib` (`sha512_256`) and `base64`,
independently of the converter. It writes gzip and BGZF data as stored deflate
blocks with mtime 0 and no file name, so the output doesn't depend on the local
zlib build. Rerunning it reproduces identical bytes.

```bash
python scripts/make_conformance.py            # rewrite valid/, invalid/, manifest.json
python scripts/check_conformance.py           # standard library only
python scripts/check_conformance.py --schema  # also validate metadata (PyYAML, jsonschema)
```

`check_conformance.py` regenerates the vectors in a temporary directory and
compares the bytes. It then checks that the manifest covers every rule in
docs/FORMAT.md, and recomputes each checksum with a separate reading of the
rules. CI runs these checks and then runs the released converter (`fhr` from PyPI)
over every vector. To add a vector, edit the generator, rerun it, and commit the
script together with its output.
